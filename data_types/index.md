## Two Data Types
  1. Primitive data types (8 - byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char)
  1. Non-primitive data types (4 - String, Array, Class, Interface)

### Eight Primitive Data Types
  - Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. 
  - A primitive type always has a value.
  - A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter.
1. **Integer Types**
   1. byte
   1. short
   1. int
   1. long
1. **Floating Point Types**
   1. float
   1. double 
1. **Other Types**
   1. boolean 
   1. char

### Below is the table for all Primitive Data Types.

| Data Type | Size      | Description                                                     |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| byte      | 1 byte    | Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127                          |
| short     | 2 bytes   | Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767                    |
| int       | 4 bytes   | Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647      |
| long      | 8 bytes   | Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| float     | 4 bytes   | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits |
| double    | 8 bytes   | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits |
| boolean   | 1 bit     | Stores true or false values                                     |
| char      | 2 bytes   | Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values               |

### Four Non-Primitive Data Types
 - Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
 - Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
 - non-primitive types can be null.
 - non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
1. **String**
   1. The String object has methods that are used to perform certain operations on strings. 
1. **Array**
1. **Class**
1. **Interface**
