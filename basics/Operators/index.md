# Java Operatos
 Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

## Types of Operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Bitwise operators

### Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

| Operator | Name         | Description                         | Example  |
|----------|--------------|-------------------------------------|----------|
| +        | Addition     | Adds together two values            | x + y    |
| -        | Subtraction  | Subtracts one value from another    | x - y    |
| *        | Multiplication| Multiplies two values               | x * y    |
| /        | Division     | Divides one value by another        | x / y    |
| %        | Modulus      | Returns the division remainder      | x % y    |
| ++       | Increment    | Increases the value of a variable by 1 | ++x     |
| --       | Decrement    | Decreases the value of a variable by 1 | --x     |

### Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
| Operator | Example  | Same As       |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| =        | x = 5    | x = 5         |
| +=       | x += 3   | x = x + 3     |
| -=       | x -= 3   | x = x - 3     |
| *=       | x *= 3   | x = x * 3     |
| |=       | x /= 3   | x = x / 3     |
| %=       | x %= 3   | x = x % 3     |
| &=       | x &= 3   | x = x & 3     |
| \|=       | x \|= 3   | x = x \| 3     |
| ^=       | x ^= 3   | x = x ^ 3     |
| >>=      | x >>= 3  | x = x >> 3    |
| <<=      | x <<= 3  | x = x << 3    |
### Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
| Operator | Name                         | Example  |
|----------|------------------------------|----------|
| ==       | Equal to                     | x == y   |
| !=       | Not equal                    | x != y   |
| >        | Greater than                 | x > y    |
| <        | Less than                    | x < y    |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to     | x >= y   |
| <=       | Less than or equal to        | x <= y   |
### Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
| Operator | Name         | Description                                   | Example                     |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| &&       | Logical and  | Returns true if both statements are true      | x < 5 && x < 10             |
| \|\|       | Logical or   | Returns true if one of the statements is true | x < 5 || x < 4              |
| !        | Logical not  | Reverses the result, returns false if true    | !(x < 5 && x < 10)          |
